    "# Programming Assignment-2\n",
    "The goal of this assingment is to allow you to practice several the following things in Python:\n",
    "1. Perfoming typical data processing (or preprocessing if you prefer). This includes all the typical data wraning such as creating news variables, combining several datasets and more \n",
    "2. Running explolatory data analysis including basic plotting of variables \n",
    "3. Perfoming basic inferential statisticals using statsmodels and scipy to run hypythesis testing and build simple statistial or econometric models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Datasets \n",
    "For this assignment, you will use the following datasets:\n",
    "### Rwanda Health Indicators\n",
    "The Excel file was generated by combining multiple CSV files, each containing data on different health indicators for Rwanda, So that each sheet in the file represent one such indicator. See below some of the input files which were used:\n",
    "- `access-to-health-care_subnational_rwa`\n",
    "- `child-mortality-rates_subnational_rwa`\n",
    "- `dhs-mobile_subnational_rwa`\n",

    "You can download the dataset from [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uvTQYS22VfXXo1Hwkm1frFx_bKkLQkcf/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=113302179168925233984&rtpof=true&sd=true).\n",

    "# Setup Input Folders\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, it is good practice to set up input folders using the [`pathlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) package. In this section, make sure to define the folders where your data is stored on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "I find it helpful to set up the working directory and input data folders right at the start of the notebook. To keep things organized, I use the naming convention: `FILE_{NAME}` for files and `DIR_{NAME}` for folders. We use capital letters because these are global variables that will be referenced throughout the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using the [`pathlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) library, which offers several advantages over traditional string-based path handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cross-platform compatibility** - automatically handles path separators (`/` vs `\\`) across different operating systems\n",
    "- **Object-oriented approach** - paths are objects with useful methods rather than strings\n",
    "- **Intuitive syntax** - use `/` operator to join paths naturally: `parent_dir / \"subfolder\" / \"file.txt\"`\n",
    "- **Built-in path operations** - methods like `.exists()`, `.is_file()`, `.parent`, `.stem`, and `.suffix`\n",
    "- **Safer path manipulation** - reduces errors from manual string concatenation and splitting\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the recommended approach for managing file paths in modern Python development.\n"

    "# Part 1: Processing Excel Files\n",
    "The primary goal is to preprocess an [Excel file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uvTQYS22VfXXo1Hwkm1frFx_bKkLQkcf/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=113302179168925233984&rtpof=true&sd=true) with multiple sheets into a unified CSV dataset that consolidates multiple indicators. Having all indicators in a single file at the same analytical unit (national, subnational) is more efficient than managing separate files and enables easier cross-indicator analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 1: Generate National-Level Summaries\n",
    "\n",
    "For each indicator, compute a single national-level value using appropriate aggregation functions such as **mean**, **sum** or **count**. For this one, all available indicators can be summarized at national level, so we will have a CSV file with one row and \n",
